## 💻 Hobby Developer
Hi, 
I'm Christopher, a computer science enthusiast based in Germany. Currently I work on these projects: First of all, I got a service called [Hive Discover](https://github.com/hive-discover) which analyzes a social network and recommend content based on user activities. For that purpose, I need an efficient database to find similar float-vectors in huge datasets. So I am developing [amableDB](https://github.com/Christopher-06/amableDB). The docker image can already be pulled and features like knn-Searching are available. Have a look at the documentation [here](https://github.com/Christopher-06/amableDB/wiki). Lastly, I started the [CryptoCoin](https://github.com/Christopher-06/Crypto-Coin) project to understand how blockchains/cryptocurrencies work.
